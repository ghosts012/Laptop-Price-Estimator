# Predicting the Price of laptops using Machine Learning
In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project to use the characteristics of laptops to predict their sale price.

* **Inputs:** Laptop characteristics such as company, ram, inches, retina display, cpu company, gpu and more.
* **Outputs:** Laptop sale price (in Euros).

Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.
We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## 1. Problem Definition

In a statement,
> Given the characteristics of a laptop and we need to predict its sale price in euros
